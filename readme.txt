## Project Overview

The provided HTML and CSS code represents a simple portfolio website showcasing a web developer's skills and projects. It uses Bootstrap for responsive design and various components such as the navigation bar, hero section, services section, portfolio section, contact form, and footer.

## Techniques Used

1. **Bootstrap Integration**: Bootstrap (version 5.3.0) was included via CDN for rapid development of a responsive layout and consistent styling across different devices.

2. **Custom CSS**: Custom CSS was utilized to override default Bootstrap styles and add personalized styling, including theme color customization using CSS variables (`--primary-color`, `--secondary-color`, `--success-color`).

3. **Navigation Bar**: Implemented a responsive navigation bar using Bootstrap's Navbar component, providing links to Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact sections.

4. **Hero Section**: Designed a hero section with a background image, heading, and subheading, aligned using Bootstrap's Container for responsive layout.

5. **Services Section**: Utilized Bootstrap's Grid System to display services/features in columns with icons, titles, and descriptions, enhancing readability and visual appeal.

6. **Portfolio Section**: Employed Bootstrap's Cards to create a responsive and organized portfolio section, showcasing projects with images, titles, and descriptions in a grid layout.

7. **Contact Form**: Styled a contact form with name, email, message fields, and a submit button using Bootstrap's Form components, ensuring user-friendly input and interaction.

8. **Footer**: Created a simple footer with copyright information and optional social media icons, enhancing website completeness and providing additional engagement options.
